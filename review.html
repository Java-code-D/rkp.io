        <h4>Dolly Baghel <small>- 5 months ago on Google</small></h4>
        <p>The bestest hotel near shree nath ji temple nathdwara. The hotel is neat and clean with all necessary animites situated at walking distance of 2 minutes to temple. The staff and Mr. kapil are so kind and humble, I am short of words to describe the way to treat their guests like their own family and take every possible care of them. I would recommend everyone to visit RK palace once if you are going nathdwara.
Jai shree krishna !! Jai shree nath ji !!</p>
